Hi, I'm Abhigna Nagaraja. I design, build, and scale software systems that serve billions of users. When I'm not thinking about software, you'll find me writing about books, productivity, and other things that catch my curiosity.

I'm currently a Staff Software Engineer at Meta, working on large-scale serverless computing platforms. Previously, I was a Senior Software Engineer at AWS API Gateway, where I worked on the service's architectural vision and protocols.

# About That Pickle...

You may have noticed a cheerful little pickle hanging around the header and favicon of this blog. It's just a whimsical pickle that I enjoy. The headband is inspired by a hachimaki, traditionally worn in Japan for focus and determination (you might recognize it from anime).

The "A" on the headband represents both being "#1 first" and the first letter of my name. Why a pickle? No specific reason - I like the pickle and it brings a smile to my face.
