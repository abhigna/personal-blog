Hi, I'm Abhigna Nagaraja. I design, build, and scale software systems that serve billions of users. When I'm not thinking about software, you'll find me writing about books, productivity, and other things that catch my curiosity.

I'm currently a Software Engineer at Meta, working on large-scale serverless computing platforms. Previously, I was a Senior Software Engineer at AWS API Gateway, where I worked on the service's architectural vision and protocols.

I write to share practical insights and lessons learned while building systems at scale, hoping to help others navigate both technical challenges and career growth.
