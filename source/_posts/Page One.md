After years of building software systems and collecting notes in various digital corners, I've finally decided to start sharing them in public. This blog is my attempt to give back to the tech community that has taught me so much over the years.

Writing has always been a powerful tool for learning - it forces you to structure your thoughts and challenges your assumptions. Through this blog, I hope to share insights from building large-scale systems, practical experiences that might help others, and explore ideas about productivity and learning.

If you're reading this, thank you for being part of this beginning. Let's see where this goes!
